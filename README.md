## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello i'm Julian (please don't say julien).

I'm a student of Arago High School, and I code C++, python, and lot of languages.

My last finish project is the [proxy-manger](https://github.com/badge881/proxy-manager) for my school because we need to change the proxy every time we change the Wi-Fi connection.

I like scientific classes

I'm working on a JSON librairy and a Web library for C++.

Have a good day (as always)
